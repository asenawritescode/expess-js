# Simple API Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you on how to start a simple API using Express.js. The code for this tutorial is hosted on GitHub, and assumes that you have already cloned the project.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your system.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

    This will install all the necessary packages specified in the `package.json` file, including Express.js.

## Usage

1. In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory. (Ignore if you are already there !)

2. Run the following command to start the API:

```
node index.js
```

    This will start the Express application and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the "Hello World!" message.



That's it! You have successfully installed and started the simple API.

Feel free to explore the code and make modifications as needed. You can find the complete code for this tutorial in the `index.js` file.

For more advanced features and functionalities, refer to the official [Express.js documentation](https://expressjs.com/).
