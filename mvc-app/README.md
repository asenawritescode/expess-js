# Express API with New Features (Still under Construction)

This is an updated version of the Express API tutorial that will include new features. The code for this tutorial is hosted on GitHub and assumes that you have already cloned the project.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your system.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

       This will install all the necessary packages specified in the `package.json` file, including Express.js, CORS, Helmet, XSS Clean, and other required dependencies.

## Usage

1. In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory.

2. Run the following command to start the API:

```shell
node start
```

   This will start the Express application, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000/healthcheck` to see the "Server is up and running" message, indicating that the API is functioning properly.

4. Upcoming Features:

  - **MVC Structure**: The API will follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, providing a structured and organized approach to developing the application.

  - **Authentication**: Authentication will be implemented to secure the API endpoints and protect sensitive data. Users will be able to authenticate using various methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth, or username/password.

  - **Middlewares**: Middlewares will be added to handle common tasks such as request validation, logging, error handling, and more. These middlewares will help in improving code reusability and maintainability.

  - **Logging**: Logging will be implemented to track application events and errors. This will help in debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.

  - **Versioning**: The API will support versioning, allowing different versions of the same resource to coexist. Resources will be organized under versioned folders, such as `app/v1/resource`, making it easier to manage and maintain backward compatibility.

  - **Rate Limiting**: Rate limiting will be implemented to prevent abuse and protect the API from excessive requests. This will help in maintaining the performance and availability of the API.

  - **Tests**: Automated tests will be added to ensure the correctness and stability of the API. These tests will cover various scenarios and edge cases, providing confidence in the functionality of the API.

  - **Status Codes**: The API will use appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. This will help in understanding the outcome of a request and handling errors gracefully.

  - **Error Handling**: Error handling will be improved to provide meaningful error messages and responses. Errors will be properly categorized and handled, ensuring a smooth user experience.

  - **Documentation with Swagger**: API documentation will be generated using Swagger, providing a detailed and interactive reference for the API endpoints, request/response structures, and available functionalities.

5. Feel free to explore the code and make modifications as needed. You will find the complete code for this tutorial in the `index.js` file.

For more advanced features and functionalities, refer to the official [Express.js documentation](https://expressjs.com/).

Enjoy building your API!

**I have not declared this as the only way to do the folder structure, but this has worked for me. There are many variations of the same thing so focus on the core concepts**
